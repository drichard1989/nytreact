The New York Times React application allows for you to search for articles that have been posted using a keywords search, article amount limit, and a year filter. Once you have searched the New York Times API, you are able to click on the article title to take you to the original source, or save the article for later viewing. Once you have saved an article, you can view all of the saved articles in one place, and then delete the ones that you do not want.
This project was completed using Mongoose and MongoDB, which is where the data is being stored. The notes are tied to the articles in MongoDB. Incorportating Mongoose and MongoDB was different than using MySQL, but showed benefits and drawbacks.
The real power of this application is the fact that it was built using React instead of a standard HTML and CSS page. This allows for the page to function without having to be re-loaded when data is returned.
